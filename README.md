## How is it done? :muscle:

Each webpage is loaded and parsed, extracting the words enclosed in `<h2 class='word-entry'>` tag.

Included is [`tagalog.pinoydictionary.com`](http://tagalog.pinoydictionary.com/) `html` [snippet](https://github.com/raymelon/tagalog-dictionary-scraper/blob/master/tagalog.pinoydictionary.com%20html%20snippet.html) containing the source of
[`http://tagalog.pinoydictionary.com/list/a/`](http://tagalog.pinoydictionary.com/list/a/) to serve as point of reference on how dictionary words from the page are extracted.

**Disclaimer:**
I do not own the `html` code cited above, it is owned by [tagalog.pinoydictionary.com](http://tagalog.pinoydictionary.com/).

## How did the project started? :thought_balloon:

The main purpose of this project is for a [Scrabble Â®](http://www.scrabble.com/) Tagalog dictionary database, but other uses may vary.

## Tools :pencil2:

- [Python3 v3.5+](https://www.python.org/) :snake:
- [beautifulsoup4 v4.5.1](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) :ramen: :package: for parsing html pages

```
  python -m pip install -U pip beautifulsoup4
```

- [requests-futures v1.0.0](https://github.com/ross/requests-futures) :zap: for request concurrency

```
  python -m pip install -U pip requests-futures
```
